        <p>Thanks to a belief in interactive design as a core element of the product workflow, Spotify was a pioneer in their formation of a Design Prototyping team, who mainly partner with embedded designers to bring their static concepts to life. But the team has had so much success they’re now looking to simultaneously automate themselves and uplevel the greater design team’s prototyping skills. To do this, they needed to offer a toolkit that would empower all designers, regardless of technical ability. To top it off, the toolkit would need to be able to tap into the Spotify API and access the trove of data that was the backbone of the company’s success.</p>
